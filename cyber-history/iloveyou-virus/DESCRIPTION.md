# ILOVEYOU Virus


Today, I'm going to tell you about the 'ILOVEYOU' virus
Otherwise known as the 'Love Bug'!
A long time ago... in the year 2000 a guy in the Phillipines wanted to make a virus.

Once the code for his virus was created, he sent it via E-Mail with the subject of ILOVEYOU.

When someone would receive this email, it had an attachment called 'LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.vbs.' Those are some weird extensions, huh?
Back in Windows 2000, extensions were hidden by default, so .vbs would be left off.
This means that users were tricked in to downloading the attachment because they thought it was just a text file!
When the users went to open the \"text\" file to read it, it was actually a visual basic script.
This script would then execute on their system and cause a lot of damage!
The virus would overwrite random files on the system, destroying valuable documents.
Then, the virus would copy the users outlook contact list and send the same 'ILOVEYOU' email to all of them! This allowed it to propogate exponentially!

Start the challenge in Desktop mode, then open a terminal and run `/challenge/run`. Navigate to 'http://127.0.0.1:5000' and click through the buttons to see pictures of the virus in action.

Then run `verify` and answer the questions about the virus to get the flag!
